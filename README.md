### 📅 June 7, 2025

This update brings key improvements to **performance**, **model management**, and the **user interface**. Here's what's new:

### 🔧 Model Management

* A **refreshed interface** is now live.
* The app is now **optimized for dark mode**. It still works in light mode, but some visuals may not display as intended.

### 🐟 Fish Speech Fix

* Fixed a bug where **Fish Speech** did not chunk text correctly, which could cause processing issues.

### 📥 Model Download Behavior

* **Chatterbox** and **Kokoro** models will **automatically download** the first time you click "Load."
* **Fish Speech** models must still be **downloaded manually** and are **not included** in the auto-download process.

### 🗣️ New Feature: Custom Kokoro Voices

* **Kokoro** now supports **custom `.pt` voice models**!
* Use the **Custom Voice Upload** section in the Kokoro interface to upload your own compatible voice files.

## 🛠️ Installation

> ⚠️ **Windows Users — Important Note on `pynini`**
> If you encounter the following error when installing `pynini`:
> `ERROR: Failed building wheel for pynini`
> You can fix this by installing it via conda:
> Pynini and wetextprocessing is needed for index-tts to work at its best

```bash
# After activating your conda environment (e.g., conda activate index-tts)
conda install -c conda-forge pynini==2.1.6
pip install WeTextProcessing --no-deps
```
---

## Option 1.

Install via [Pinokio](https://pinokio.co)
You can use the Pinokio script here for one-click setup:
[Pinokio App Installer](https://pinokio-home.netlify.app/item?uri=https://github.com/SUP3RMASS1VE/Ultimate-TTS-Studio-SUP3R-Edition-Pinokio)

### Option 1a: Install via [Dione](https://getdione.app)

## Option 2

### 🔁 **Auto-Installer Method (Recommended)**

This is the fastest way to get started. It uses a built-in installer script for automatic setup and app launching.

> 🛠️ **Before You Begin:**
> Make sure you have **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** installed on your system.
> You can download Miniconda here: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SUP3RMASS1VE/Ultimate-TTS-Studio-SUP3R-Edition.git
cd Ultimate-TTS-Studio-SUP3R-Edition
```

## Option 3

[Espeak-ng](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) is needed for Kokoro to work at its best.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SUP3RMASS1VE/Ultimate-TTS-Studio-SUP3R-Edition.git
cd Ultimate-TTS-Studio-SUP3R-Edition
```

### 2. Create a Python virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### 3. Activate the environment

* **Windows**:

  ```bash
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install `uv` (optional but recommended for speed)

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 5. Install dependencies

#### Install PyTorch (CUDA 12.8 build)

```bash
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

#### Install other requirements

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 💡 If you're not using `uv`, you can just use `pip install` in its place.

## 🧠 First-Time Setup Tips

### 📥 Download Fish Speech Model (one-time)

To use **Fish Speech**, you must download the model checkpoint from Hugging Face. This requires a Hugging Face account and access token.

### 🔐 Step-by-Step:

1. **Create an account (if needed):**
   [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join)

2. **Get your access token:**
   Visit [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a **read token**.

3. **Log in via CLI:**

   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

   Paste your token when prompted.

4. **(Optional)** Accept the model license:
   Visit [https://huggingface.co/fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini](https://huggingface.co/fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini) and click **"Access repository"** if prompted.

5. **Download the model:**

   ```bash
   huggingface-cli download fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini --local-dir checkpoints/openaudio-s1-mini
   ```

## ▶️ Run the Studio

```bash
python launch.py
```

This will launch a local Gradio interface at:
📍 `http://127.0.0.1:7860`
